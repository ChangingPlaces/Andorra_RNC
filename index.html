                        Urban environments are inherently temporal: they contain static artifacts (buildings, roads, public or open spaces) that
                        are staged to support dynamic activities (movements, traffic, commerce or stay). For centuries, planners,
                        developers and governments were investigating these relationships in an attempt to improve the design
                        and performance of successful urban spaces [Krier, 1979].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, more empirical analysis of users&rsquo; engagement with urban environments has always been challenging: [Gehl,
                        2013, &Ccedil;olak, et al. 2015] Lack of data and scarcity of tools left room for unproven assessments,
                        sometimes leading to poor decision-making. But recent advancements in data and machine learning carry
                        a promise to potentially reverse this approach: instead of looking at the form to infer behavior,
                        can we look at behavior and potentially suggest urban form?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This study explores a novel method to analyze diverse behavioral patterns in large urban population and to associate them
                        with discrete urban features. Through such coupling, this work aims to suggest correlations between
                        human dynamics and the characteristics of urban places: Which city form has greater potential to
                        attract large, heterogeneous and diverse crowds? What amenities, services and urban features produce
                        highly active urban places? And what keeps us staying at a specific street corner for several minutes
                        or hours? - Even if some of these inquiries could be roughly addressed through traditional methods,
                        a city-scale, discrete and evidence based correlation between urban features and human dynamics has
                        yet to be fully explored [Ratti, 2006].

                        Novel Methods for Urban Analysis Through Telecom Data
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Utilizing telecom data for spatial analysis has been widely researched and practiced. In the past few decades, the advent
                        of Location Based Services [LBS] has sparked the interests of urbanists who wished to sense the &lsquo;beating
                        pulse&rsquo; of the city and allowed them near real-time comprehension of urban dynamics [Becker,
                        2011, Gkatziaki et al., 2017].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet in many cases, low data resolution or limited accuracy forced researchers to generalize behavioral patterns over large
                        tracts of the city. At the same time, measuring highly-accurate behaviors was mostly available through
                        participatory processes or by using specialized equipment; These limitations bounded discrete spatial
                        analysis to confined and small portions of the city [Reades, 2007].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, higher spatial and temporal resolution data can be obtained through signal strengths aggregation from multiple cell-towers
                        and by using geolocation techniques such as Received Signal Strength and triangulation [Steenbruggen,
                        2013]. This study also provides a comparative analysis of temporal data sources in the context of
                        urban planning and suggest potential coupling of various sources to achieve large scale, near-GPS
                        accuracy.

                        Machine Learning the Urban Form: Case study Andorra

                        As a case study, this work examines the country of Andorra (EU) with a focus on its major urban areas. A European tourist
                        city-state, Andorra is now undergoing changes to its visitors&rsquo; population as well a wave of
                        new urban development. The country features diverse population of locals, visitors and tourists which
                        is challenging to survey using traditional methods. The purpose of the described method is to correlate
                        locals and visitors&rsquo; dynamics to a set of discrete urban features describing Andorra's cityscape
                        and eventually aid in understanding and designing highly-performing urban interventions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This method involves dividing Andorra&rsquo;s study area into microscopic, regularly spaced cells and computing two sets
                        of metrics:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (A) Human Dynamics: a measure of urban performance is generated based on a set of timestamped geolocated cellphone traces
                        associated with individuals. This is achieved by segmenting the data into discrete time periods,
                        finding &lsquo;staypoints&rsquo; [Li et al., 2008] and identifying spatial clusters within each time
                        period [Ester et al., 1996]. The occurrence of specific clusters [dense, heterogeneous, persistent
                        and stationary] is considered as an indication of higher social activity and interaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (B) Urban Features: Diverse set of urban features are then defined and computed for each grid cell. Machine Learning algorithms
                        (such as Random Forest) which model the occurrence of clusters as a function of these features are
                        then trained on the city&rsquo;s grid-cells. All through this process, the accuracy of this model
                        is tested against unbiased random grid cells.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the most prevailing urban features in correlation to the presence of clusters are extracted using this model. Of
                        these, the presence of open space, impact of amenities, the degree of built-up area and the highest
                        <em>
                            betweenness
                        </em>
                        centrality of the road network nodes appeared to largely dominate. Additional models have been developed to explain other
                        cluster characteristics such as diversity and persistence. These will be reported on in the full
                        paper.
