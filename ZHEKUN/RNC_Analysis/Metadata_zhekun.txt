Timestamp: 
Longitude: GPS location
Latitude: GPS location

Ec/No: Energy per Chip of the Pilot Channel Over the Noise Power Density
       Reflects how strong a signal is above the noise in a sell(sector) and measured in dB
       (Also known as signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) per bit, the higher EcNo indicates a better channel)

RSCP: Received Signal Code Power
      Downlink power received by the UE receiver on the pilot channel and measured in dBm
      (A higher RSCP indicates a better channel) 

Static/Mobile

Indoor/Outdoor

HASH_IMEI: International Mobile Equipment Identity
	   Identify related to the phone equipment

IMEI_TAC: Type Allocation Code
          Identify wireless devices, uniquely identify a model of phone


Cellid: a generally unique number used to identify each base transceiver station or sector of a BTS within a location area code(LAC) if not within a GSM network

LAC: Location Area Code
