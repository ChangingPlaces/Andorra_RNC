//Files Structure Explanation
  ReadMe_RNC_Analysis_Structure.jpg - File structure diagram of the folder

//Raw Data
  FTP database:
  home/data_repository/datasets/telecom/rnc/2016-AndorraTelecom-RNC
  home/data_repository/datasets/telecom/rnc/2016-AndorraTelecom-RNC-2

//Python files
  1_Check_File_in_Oneday: check if each original csv file contains data of multiple days or single days
  2_File_Differ_in_Day: Categorize datapoint based on the date and produce csv files with each only contains one day datapoints 
			(due to computing power, produce multiple csv files for one day to avoid problem, if so, next use 3_Combine_CSV.py)
  2b_File_Differ_in_Day_SHORTCUT: see above, but produce one csv file for one day, can skip 3_Combine_CSV.py
  3_Combine_CSV: Combine the same days csv files into one csv file — *** outputcsv_date_combined folder
  4_Divide_Day_in_Person: Go through each day’s csv file, and produce csv files of each ID — *** outputcsv_date_combined_person_folder
  5_Person_Staypoints: Calculate staypoints for each ID for each day - *** staypoints_date_JSON folder
  6_Staypoints_AssignID_Simple: create simplified staypoints JSON file and ID reference table - *** additional files to staypoints_date_JSON folder
  C1_Timeslice_DBSCAN_on_SIMPLEJSON: Slice staypoints JSON of each day into every 5 mins, prepare files for clustering - *** staypoints_date_JSON_clustering folder
  C2_Clustering_Algorithm_DBSCAN_on_SIMPLEJSON: DBSCAN cluster, can adjust parameters of radius and min people - *** additional files to staypoints_date_JSON_clustering folder



//Other Files
  mcc_table_final.csv - mcc country code reference table
  Metadata_zhekun.txt - raw data’s metadata


//Output Files

  *** outputcsv_date_combined folder
      Each csv file is named after the day containing all the RNC data of that day
      Sample file name “20160630.csv”

  *** outputcsv_date_combined_person folder
      Each subfolder is named after the day, within each subfolder, it contains csv files of RNC datapoint of each individual (named after each ID number)
      Sample subfolder name “20160603”; Within subfolder, sample file name “0950605322563703584819b7cc87bf2cf53ad51e69244d3d897649868a3cb263.csv”

  *** staypoints_date_JSON folder
      Sample file name “20160630_id_table.csv” - id reference table from old id (RNC data) to new id
                       “20160630_person_staypoints_simple.json” - simplified staypoints for each day - format of data structure please refer to explanation in 6_Staypoints_AssignID_Simple.py
                       “20160630_person_staypoints.json” - original staypoints for each day (has info on Ec/No, RSCP, cell tower and original ID) - format of data structure please refer to explanation in 5_Person_Staypoints.py 

  *** staypoints_date_JSON_clustering folder
      Sample file name “20160630_clustering_slice_simple.json” - timesliced staypoints json file every 5 mins - format of data structure please refer to explanation in C1_Timeslice_DBSCAN_on_SIMPLEJSON.py
      Sample subfolder name “20160603”; Within subfolder, sample file name “20160630_clustering_clusters_R30_P15_simple.json” - clustering files with parameters radius 30 meters and min people 15 - format of data structure please refer to explanation in C2_Clustering_Algorithm_DBSCAN_on_SIMPLEJSON.py
